## :rocket: About The Project

![screenshot](https://user-imagesexample./screenshot.JPG)

Introducing our command-line application that simplifies the process of creating high-quality, professional READMEs. Our application prompts users for information about their repository and generates a README.md file with sections that include a Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

Users can easily customize the title of their project, as well as provide a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, which will be added to their README.

The application also provides a list of license options to choose from, with the selected license displayed as a badge at the top of the README and a notice added to the License section. Users can also enter their GitHub username and email address, which will be added to the Questions section with a link to their GitHub profile and instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

To make navigation easy, the README includes a Table of Contents with clickable links that take users directly to the corresponding section of the document. With our command-line application, creating a comprehensive and polished README has never been easier.
