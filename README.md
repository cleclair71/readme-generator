## :rocket: About The Project

![screenshot](https://user-imagesexample./screenshot.JPG)

Introducing our command-line application that simplifies the process of creating high-quality, professional READMEs. Our application prompts users for information about their repository and generates a README.md file with sections that include a Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

Users can easily customize the title of their project, as well as provide a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, which will be added to their README.

The application also provides a list of license options to choose from, with the selected license displayed as a badge at the top of the README and a notice added to the License section. Users can also enter their GitHub username and email address, which will be added to the Questions section with a link to their GitHub profile and instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

To make navigation easy, the README includes a Table of Contents with clickable links that take users directly to the corresponding section of the document. With our command-line application, creating a comprehensive and polished README has never been easier.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

To generate your own README, start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the git clone command. 

Once you have the Node project on your local machine, run **npm install** to install the required npm package dependencies specified in the package.json file. 

The * [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package will prompt you for your inputs from the command line. To begin generating your README, navigate to the develop folder in the command line and run the command node index.js. 

This will start the application and prompt you to answer the required prompts in the command line. 

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be generated and saved as README.md in the develop folder. 

Additionally, the README will have some automatically generated badges for your repository courtesy of shields.io.

## :computer: Usage
  When node index.js is executed, the application will prompt you through a series of questions in the command line using the inquirer package. These questions will cover your GitHub profile and your project. 
  
  Based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts, the application will conditionally generate markdown and a table of contents.
