## About The Project

![screenshot](https://user-imagesexample./screenshot.JPG)

Introducing our command-line application that simplifies the process of creating high-quality, professional READMEs. Our application prompts users for information about their repository and generates a README.md file with sections that include a Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Installation

To generate your own README, start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the git clone command. Once you have the Node project on your local machine, run **npm install** to install the required npm package dependencies specified in the package.json file. The * [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package will prompt you for your inputs from the command line. To begin generating your README, navigate to the develop folder in the command line and run the command node index.js. This will start the application and prompt you to answer the required prompts in the command line. After answering all the prompts, your README file will be generated and saved as README.md in the develop folder. Additionally, the README will have some automatically generated badges for your repository courtesy of shields.io.

## Usage
  When node index.js is executed, the application will prompt you through a series of questions in the command line using the inquirer package. These questions will cover your GitHub profile and your project. Based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts, the application will conditionally generate markdown and a table of contents.
